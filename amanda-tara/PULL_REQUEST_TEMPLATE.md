#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Amanda and Tara paired together. It took about 4 hours.**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we set the viewport and initial scale
  2. Next, we added links to normalize.css, vendor css files, and the base, layout, and modules css files we created.
  3. We answered the questions prompted in the HTML file.
  4. We added the hamburger menu before switching roles and driver/navigator.
  5. Then we tackled the layout, styling, and behavior of the nav menu at different screen sizes.
  6. Completed styling and README.md
